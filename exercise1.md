The language I have chosen for this exercise is Java.

Java has quite a few linters to choose from, depending on the development team's needs. Several JAVA IDE's such as IntelliJ and Eclipse provide their own tools for linting. The development team might use varying platforms for their own development workflow, so relying on built-in tools for consistent results across the team might not be an option. Some of the more popular, atleast somewhat platform independent linters seem to be CheckStyle and PMD. Two of the most prevalent build tools in the Java ecosystem are Maven and Gradle. For testing there's wide array of choices depending on the team's specific requirements. Junit is commonly used for unit testing, and for example testing in the spirit of behavior driven development can be done with Cucumber.

One suitable alternative to Github's or Jenkins' CI / CD pipeline is Gitlab. Gitlab is probably Github's largest competitor in the realm of version control platforms, and it also offersCI / CD services. I'm not sure if there is a clear-cut answer to whether self-hosted or cloud-based Gitlab CI / CD service is the way to go. One restricting factor might be the hardware requirements which are listed here: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html. The team might not have a machine suitable for running the platform locally.
